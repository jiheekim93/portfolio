This is the first website that I have made.

WEBSITE LINK : https://www.jiheekim03.com

OVERALL APPROACH TAKEN: A website with a simple / sleek look and easy to be read by visitors.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: I used CSS and HTML for the basic structure and 
jQuery and Javascript for putting the majority of the contents / carousel / urls to link to another web pages. 

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS: I wanted to make my carousel move smoothly but couldn't find a way yet.
also I found out the website on other web browsers (Chrome works fine) seems little off (viewport wise). 
I should look in to their compatibility for that.

FINAL COMMENT: I still have things to add. It just never ends. I will put Contact me section so visitors can 
send me a message. It was good to make my own website that I can put its link on my LinkedIn profile. 
I think I can use this as one of my projects since I am proud of the outcome. 
I think it also helps that recruiters can see the website that I built.
